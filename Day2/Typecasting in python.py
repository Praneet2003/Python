# Conversion of datatype into another datatype.
# Python supports wide variety of function,method,like:- int(),float(),str(),tuple(),ord(),hex(),oct(),set(),list(),dict() etc
# there are two tyoe of typeconversion:-
# 1:) Explicit TypeCosting:-(It is done by user by using the above functions and methods)
# 2:) Implicit TypeCasting:- it is done by interpreter which converts a smaller data into a larger data type

# Explicit TypeCasting:-
# type conversion done via developer or programmers.
# Eg:-
string = "15"
num = 7
string_num = int(string)
sum = num + string_num
print("The Sume after type Conversion is :",sum) 

#Implicit TypeCasting:-
a =1.9
b=8
sum = a+b
print("\n")
print(a+b)
