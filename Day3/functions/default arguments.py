# Default Arguments:- Providing values during function creation.
#Eg:-
def average(a =9, b =3):
    print("The average is : ",(a+b)/2)
# we can also provide a default value while creating a function,
# this way the function assumes that a value is not provided in the function call.
print(average(10,30))
