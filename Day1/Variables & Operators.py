# Variables:-
#variables :-
# It Stores the data value, at a specific memay location
# Eg:- 
# G = 127406
# b = "planet"
# C = false
# d = None.

#Data types :-
# Data types specifies the type of value Which a variable stores.
# we can find the datatype of any variable Using type().
# Eg:-
a = 78
print("The datatype of a 14", type(a))

# 1:)Numeric data: int, float, Complex int 3,4, 9, 100 che fhat 28, 962 complex 2172, SHOL
# 2:)Text data; str= "Hello world"
# 3:)Boolean data. True, false.
# 4:)sequence data:- list, tuple.


# list-
# It is an ordered collection of data sepeated by looms, and enclosed within square brackets []
# eg:-
list1 = [1, 23, "Hello", [1, 26, 14.67,"hello world"],"Bye"]
print(list1)
# * list are mutable (Changeable)

# Tuple:-
# it is also ordered collection of dada seperated by commas, and enclosed within parenthesis ()
tuple1 = ("ust", 1.5, ("Hello", 1, "world"))
print(tuple1)
# Tuples au immutable (not-changeable)

# Mapped data:
# 1:) Dictonary
# Ditory in an unordered colletion of date Which consist of Key:value pairs enclosed within curly braces {}.
# eg- 
dict1 = {"name": "planet", "age": 20, "CanVote": True}
print(dict1)
# It is also mutable

# 2:)set 
# Set is an ordered collection of data seperated by commas within curly braces {}
#Eg:-
Set1 = {"Apple","Banana","Cherry",True,29,11}
print(Set1)
# Set are immutable, but you can delete or add new items to it.
# Duplicates are not allowed,i.e they are ignored by interpreter.
